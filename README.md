## Introduction
This app computes the body mass index (BMI) for a given person. Given the values for height and weight, 
it determines the BMI and concludes in what category is that person: *underweight, normal, overweight* or *obese*

## How to use it
- Height can either be given in centimeters or feet/inches units, 
  - for feet/inches, use the principal input for feet and the secondary for inches,
  - for centimeters, use only principal input and don't worry about secondary one.
- Weight in kilograms or pounds. 
- After introducing the numerical values, their units have to be indicated. 
- Then click the submit button to determine the BMI and the category.
